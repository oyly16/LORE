# Implementation

Our code is tested with python==3.10.0, torch==2.6.0, transformers==4.49.0, flux-dev model.

Go to [FLUX](https://github.com/black-forest-labs/flux) codebase for more requirements.

To run with local checkpoints, edit model paths in [this file](src/flux/util_lore.py). 


# Image Editing

Examples are provided in /src/run_examples.sh
```
cd src
mkdir outputs_demo
bash run_examples.sh
```

Check [this script](src/demo_lore.py) for tuning edting parameters.

# Gradio Demo

To run our [HF space demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/oyly/LORE) locally, run app.py
```
cd src
mkdir outputs_gradio
python app.py
```
Samples will be saved to /src/outputs_gradio.

We also support a demo that divide inverse and editing, which saves generation time.

Due to limited computational resources, you may resize the images to 800 pixels (long side) while preserving the aspect ratio.

```
cd src
mkdir outputs_gradio
(run locally) python gradio_lore.py --resize 800
(run sharing) python gradio_lore.py --resize 800 --share
```


# Visualize Attention Maps

We further add a demo to visualize attention maps of ours optimization noise comparing to inversion noise.

Examples are provided in /src/run_vis_attnmaps.sh
```
cd src
mkdir outputs_attnmap
bash run_vis_attnmaps.sh
```
